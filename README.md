## :book: Overview
pyTCR is a physics-based model developed in python to estimate rainfall induced by tropical cyclones (TCs). It is largely based on the TCR model described by [Zhu *et al.*, 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013GL058284) and [Lu *et al.*, 2018](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/75/7/jas-d-17-0264.1.xml). PyTCR simulates convective TC rainfall by correlating the precipitation rate with the total upward velocity within the TC vortex. It integrates seamlessly with outputs from [a tropical cyclone downscaling model](https://github.com/linjonathan/tropical_cyclone_risk) (see [Lin *et al.,* 2023](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003686)) to generate detailed spatial-temporal rainfall patterns that align with hurricane tracks.

## :wrench: Installation

1. To install the latest stable release from `PyPI`:
    ```sh
    pip install pyTCR
    ```
    OR `conda`:
    ```sh
    conda install -c conda-forge pyTCR
    ```
2. To get the latest (unstable) development version from GitHub:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/levuvietphong/pyTCR.git
    cd pyTCR
    pip install .
    ```

    > ðŸ’¡ **Note:**
    > *This installs the most recent updates, which may include new features and bug fixes that are not yet available in the stable release. Cloning the repository also gives you access to the tutorial in the notebooks folder.*

## :arrow_forward: Getting Started
This repository provides a collection of [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/levuvietphong/pyTCR/tree/main/notebooks) designed to facilitate the use of PyTCR for generating and visualizing rainfall and wind speed induced by TCs. These notebooks cover various use cases and data sources, providing comprehensive guidance for users.

0. [Downloading Tropical Cyclone Data:](./notebooks/ex0_download_tracks_from_cmip6.ipynb) illustrates the process of downloading CMIP6 tropical cyclone tracks that have undergone downscaling using the tropical cyclone downscaling [model](https://github.com/linjonathan/tropical_cyclone_risk).

1. [Visualizing Tropical Cyclone Tracks:](./notebooks/ex1_tropical_cyclone_tracks.ipynb) showcases the visualization of tropical cyclone tracks and their density, utilizing both observational data and downscaled CMIP6 outputs.

2. [Rainfall Simulation:](./notebooks/ex2_rainfall_generation.ipynb) uses outputs from the tropical cyclone downscaling model to simulate rainfall driven by tropical cyclones. This includes rainfall at a specific location and over the entire domain of the tropical cyclone tracks.

3. [Wind Speed Generation:](./notebooks/ex3_wind_speed_generation.ipynb) demonstrates the generation of spatially and temporally varying wind speeds from downscaled CMIP6 outputs.

4. [Rainfall within a Polygon:](./notebooks/ex4_rainfall_polygons_generation.ipynb) outlines the process of generating total rainfall within polygons loaded from shapefiles.

5. [Multiple Rainfall Events within a Polygon:](./notebooks/ex5_multiple_rainfall_event_polygon.ipynb) generates multiple total rainfall events from multiple tropical cyclone tracks within a polygon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Downscaled tropical cyclone tracks for various CMIP6 models (including `historical` and `ssp585` experiments) are available for download [here](https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/setxuifl/tropical_cyclones/downscaled_cmip6_tracks).

## :framed_picture: Gallery
The following figures illustrate the inputs used and results obtained from PyTCR:

- **Tropical cyclone tracks:** The figure below shows the tracks of tropical cyclones downscaled from outputs from E3SM v1.0 model, Reanalysis ERA5, and best track observations.

- **Spatial Distribution of Total Rainfall:** The image below shows the spatial distribution of total rainfall along three storm tracks that made landfall in the Southeast Texas (SETx) region.

- **Time Series of Precipitation:** The figure below depicts the time series of precipitation at a specific location (29.907Â°N, 94.900Â°W) within the SETx region.
