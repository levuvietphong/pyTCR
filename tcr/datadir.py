This module defines how the data directory for the library is determined.

By default, it uses a subdirectory named `data` located relative to the current file.
However, this can now be overridden by user configuration.

    """
    Determines the directory path for data storage based on various sources of configuration.

    This function checks for the data directory in the following order of precedence:
    1. If an override path is provided as an argument, it is returned.
    2. If a config file exists in standard locations, the `data_dir` from the file is returned.
       - On Windows, it checks the `APPDATA` directory.
       - On other platforms, it checks `~/.config/tcr/config.yaml`.
    3. If none of the above sources provide a path, a default `DATA_DIR` constant is returned.

    Args:
        override (str, optional): A user-specified directory path to override all other sources.
        Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        str: The resolved data directory path.
